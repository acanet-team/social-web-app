              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 16px" >
                1. From novice to Blockchain expert: The #1 criteria for success
                in anything is to be fascinated. If you combine your interest in
                Blockchain with this training, you&apos;ve got everything you
                need to become an expert in the field - even if you&apos;re
                unsure where to begin. 
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 16px" >
                2. A solid foundation in cryptography: Blockchain is a complex
                system that relies on the principles of cryptography. We will
                start with a solid understanding of hash functions, digital
                signatures, and public-key cryptography, and gradually move on
                to more advanced topics like blockchain consensus algorithms and
                smart contracts.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 16px" >
                3. A practical understanding of Blockchain: Blockchain is a
                decentralized, distributed ledger that securely records
                transactions across multiple computers. We will start by
                learning how to create a simple blockchain in JavaScript, and
                gradually move on to more advanced topics like consensus
                algorithms, smart contracts, and the application of blockchain
                in various industries.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 16px" >
                4. A strong foundation in Blockchain technology: Blockchain is a
                complex technology that requires a solid understanding of
                various concepts. We will start by learning about the
                fundamentals of blockchain, such as the blockchain structure,
                consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. Throughout this
                course, we will also learn how to create and deploy smart
                contracts using popular blockchain platforms like Ethereum and
                Hyperledger Fabric.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 16px" >
                5. A hands-on learning experience: This course will be entirely
                hands-on, meaning you will develop your own projects and
                practice with real-world examples. Throughout this course, you
                will learn how to create simple applications, smart contracts,
                and other blockchain-related technologies. When you finish, you
                will be 100% ready to apply your skills to anything
                Blockchain-related.

      Here is what you will get with this course:
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px" >
      1. From novice to Blockchain expert: The #1 criteria for success
      in anything is to be fascinated. If you combine your interest in
      Blockchain with this training, you&apos;ve got everything you
      need to become an expert in the field - even if you&apos;re
      unsure where to begin. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px" >
      2. A solid foundation in cryptography: Blockchain is a complex
      system that relies on the principles of cryptography. We will
      start with a solid understanding of hash functions, digital
      signatures, and public-key cryptography, and gradually move on
      to more advanced topics like blockchain consensus algorithms and
      smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px" >
      3. A practical understanding of Blockchain: Blockchain is a
      decentralized, distributed ledger that securely records
      transactions across multiple computers. We will start by
      learning how to create a simple blockchain in JavaScript, and
      gradually move on to more advanced topics like consensus
      algorithms, smart contracts, and the application of blockchain
      in various industries.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px" >
      4. A strong foundation in Blockchain technology: Blockchain is a
      complex technology that requires a solid understanding of
      various concepts. We will start by learning about the
      fundamentals of blockchain, such as the blockchain structure,
      consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. Throughout this
      course, we will also learn how to create and deploy smart
      contracts using popular blockchain platforms like Ethereum and
      Hyperledger Fabric.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px" >
      5. A hands-on learning experience: This course will be entirely
      hands-on, meaning you will develop your own projects and
      practice with real-world examples. Throughout this course, you
      will learn how to create simple applications, smart contracts,
      and other blockchain-related technologies. When you finish, you
      will be 100% ready to apply your skills to anything
      Blockchain-related.
